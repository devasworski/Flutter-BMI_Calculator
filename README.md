This is a app created as part of the [London App Brewery: Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart), I have attended on [LinkedInLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/flutter-part-07-building-the-ui-or-flutter-part-07-building-uis/how-to-use-flutter-themes?u=2374954).

## The Goal

The objective of this tutorial was to look at how one we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve customised beautiful user interface designs.

## What was done

A Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It is a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom UI/UX design.
